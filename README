This project will connect to the app store's in app purchase service. 
Unlike the StoreKit framework, it will also work in the iOS simulator,
using the SimStoreKit simulator library.

CLONING

After cloning, you must initialize the git submodule:

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

NOTE:

Products that have already been purchased are stored in the keyring.
For testing purchases, these entries are wiped whenever the test app
starts. Do not do this in production code.
